# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a Rust-based keyboard mouse control tool, inspired by the Mouseless application. The tool will enable users to control mouse operations entirely through keyboard inputs, helping to reduce wrist strain and improve productivity for users who prefer keyboard-centric workflows.

The application will provide multiple interaction modes including basic cursor movement, grid-based positioning, and area-based navigation, all while maintaining cross-platform compatibility and high performance through Rust's system-level capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a computer user experiencing wrist pain from mouse usage, I want to control my mouse cursor using keyboard keys, so that I can reduce physical strain while maintaining productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user activates the tool THEN the system SHALL capture keyboard input for mouse control
2. WHEN the user presses movement keys (I/K/J/L) THEN the system SHALL move the mouse cursor in the corresponding direction
3. WHEN the user presses click keys (N for left click, M for right click) THEN the system SHALL execute the corresponding mouse click at the current cursor position
4. WHEN the user presses the hold key (B) THEN the system SHALL toggle mouse button hold state
5. WHEN the user presses scroll keys (U/O for vertical, Y/P for horizontal) THEN the system SHALL scroll in the corresponding direction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to quickly position my mouse cursor to specific screen locations using a grid system, so that I can efficiently navigate to precise locations without multiple movement commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user activates grid mode THEN the system SHALL display a configurable grid overlay on the screen
2. WHEN the user types a two-key combination shown in a grid cell THEN the system SHALL move the mouse cursor to the center of that grid cell
3. WHEN the grid is active THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators for each grid cell with their corresponding key combinations
4. IF the user configures grid size THEN the system SHALL adjust the number of grid cells accordingly
5. WHEN the user exits grid mode THEN the system SHALL hide the grid overlay and return to normal mode

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who is not familiar with complex key combinations, I want to use a simple area-based navigation system, so that I can quickly move my cursor to general screen regions using intuitive key mappings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user activates area mode THEN the system SHALL divide the screen into 9 distinct areas
2. WHEN the user presses area keys (Q/W/E/A/S/D/Z/X/C) THEN the system SHALL move the mouse cursor to the center of the corresponding area
3. WHEN the user presses combination keys (e.g., Q+E) THEN the system SHALL move the cursor to the intersection or highlighted area between the two regions
4. WHEN area mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the 9 areas and their key mappings
5. IF the user has multiple monitors THEN the system SHALL handle area division across all connected displays

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user working with multiple monitors, I want to quickly switch my mouse cursor between different screens, so that I can efficiently work across my multi-monitor setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses screen keys (1/2/3) THEN the system SHALL move the mouse cursor to the center of the corresponding monitor
2. IF the system detects multiple monitors THEN the system SHALL automatically map keys to available displays
3. WHEN only one monitor is connected THEN the system SHALL disable multi-screen functionality
4. IF more than 3 monitors are connected THEN the system SHALL map the first 3 monitors to keys 1, 2, and 3
5. WHEN switching screens THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the target screen

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the activation method and key bindings, so that I can adapt the tool to my personal workflow and avoid conflicts with other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user configures activation keys THEN the system SHALL support binding to CapsLock, Ctrl, Shift, Command, or Option keys
2. WHEN the user sets double-click activation THEN the system SHALL require two rapid key presses to activate
3. IF the user customizes key bindings THEN the system SHALL save and load these preferences
4. WHEN the user changes speed settings THEN the system SHALL adjust cursor movement velocity accordingly
5. WHEN the user presses the speed toggle key (F) THEN the system SHALL switch between fast and slow movement modes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily enable and disable the mouse control system, so that I can quickly return to normal mouse operation when needed without interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses the exit key (Esc or Space) THEN the system SHALL deactivate mouse control mode
2. WHEN Space is used to exit THEN the system SHALL NOT generate a space character in the active application
3. WHEN the system is deactivated THEN the system SHALL restore normal keyboard input behavior
4. IF the system encounters an error THEN the system SHALL automatically deactivate and restore normal input
5. WHEN the system is inactive THEN the system SHALL consume minimal system resources

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want the tool to work reliably with macOS system features and security requirements, so that I can use it seamlessly in my Mac workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on macOS THEN the system SHALL provide full mouse control functionality
2. WHEN the application requests accessibility permissions THEN the system SHALL guide the user through macOS accessibility settings
3. IF the system lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL display clear instructions for enabling accessibility access
4. WHEN the application integrates with macOS THEN the system SHALL respect system-level keyboard shortcuts and not interfere with essential Mac functions
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL verify macOS compatibility and required permissions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a frequent computer user, I want the system to learn my usage patterns and predict where I'm likely to click next, so that I can navigate more efficiently with fewer keystrokes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user activates prediction mode THEN the system SHALL analyze current screen content and highlight likely click targets
2. WHEN the system has usage history THEN the system SHALL prioritize frequently accessed areas and applications
3. WHEN the system detects common UI patterns THEN the system SHALL predict typical interaction flows (e.g., form fields, dialog buttons)
4. IF the user is in a specific application THEN the system SHALL use application-specific prediction models
5. WHEN prediction targets are displayed THEN the system SHALL show numbered or lettered shortcuts for quick selection
6. WHEN the user selects a predicted target THEN the system SHALL move the cursor to that location and optionally perform the click
7. IF predictions are incorrect THEN the system SHALL learn from user corrections and improve future predictions
8. WHEN the system lacks sufficient data THEN the system SHALL fall back to basic heuristics (center of buttons, start of text fields, etc.)

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user who values aesthetic and intuitive interfaces, I want the mouse control tool to provide beautiful, smooth animations and clear visual feedback, so that the experience feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cursor moves THEN the system SHALL display smooth easing animations with customizable speed curves
2. WHEN modes are activated THEN the system SHALL show elegant transition animations (fade-in, scale, slide effects)
3. WHEN grid or area overlays appear THEN the system SHALL use subtle entrance animations (ripple effect, sequential reveal)
4. WHEN targets are highlighted THEN the system SHALL use pulsing glow effects or breathing animations to draw attention
5. WHEN the user hovers over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback with micro-animations
6. WHEN prediction targets are shown THEN the system SHALL use confidence-based visual styling (opacity, size, color intensity)
7. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display gentle shake animations or color transitions to indicate issues
8. IF the system is in dark mode THEN the system SHALL adapt all UI elements with appropriate dark theme colors and reduced brightness
9. WHEN overlays are displayed THEN the system SHALL use glassmorphism or neumorphism design principles for modern aesthetics
10. WHEN the tool is activated THEN the system SHALL show a subtle system-wide visual indicator (menu bar icon change, screen edge glow)

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user concerned about system performance, I want the mouse control tool to have minimal impact on system resources, so that it doesn't slow down my other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL consume less than 50MB of RAM
2. WHEN the application is idle THEN the system SHALL use less than 1% CPU on average
3. WHEN processing input events THEN the system SHALL respond within 10 milliseconds
4. IF the system detects high resource usage THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics
5. WHEN the application exits THEN the system SHALL properly clean up all allocated resources
